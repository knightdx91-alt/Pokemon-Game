# SessionStart hook: force every session onto `main` for every repo.
#
# Policy (see each repo's CLAUDE.md): we develop directly on `main` — no
# feature branches, no PRs, straight commits. Claude Code on the web creates a
# fresh per-session branch and instructs the agent to use it; this hook undoes
# that by switching every checked-out repo back to `main` at session start.
#
# This script is intentionally self-contained and does NOT rely on
# $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (which can be unset in multi-repo workspaces). It scans
# the workspace for git repos and switches each one to `main`. The same script
# is installed in every repo, so whichever one loads it, all repos get fixed.
