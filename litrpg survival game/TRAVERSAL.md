# Traversal & Exploration Gating

> Our original "HMs": capabilities that gate **movement and reachability** — cross water, scale
> cliffs, light caves, break rubble, wade hazards. Shapes zone connectivity, shortcuts, and secret
> access, so it constrains map layout. Companion to `WORLD.md`, `CRAFTING.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
> `HIDDEN_LAYER.md`. **Status:** brainstorming / pre-implementation.

## 0. Principle — gate POCKETS, not regions

Danger-by-depth means **no hard region gating** (`WORLD.md`). So traversal gating controls
**reachability of sub-areas, shortcuts, and secrets**, not whole regions. You can walk anywhere; some
*loot, caches, and shortcuts* need the right capability. This pairs with **visible temptation**
(`DESIGN.md`): you can SEE the reward across the water you can't yet cross — and come back for it.

## 1. Traversal Capabilities (the vocabulary maps use)

| Capability | Passes | Obtained via (multiple paths) |
|---|---|---|
| **Ford / Swim** | deep water | crafted Tidewalk rig · a Tide creature ferry · Beast-Kin class |
| **Climb** | cliffs, ledges | climbing kit · Ranger/Stoneclimb skill · a climbing creature |
| **Glide / Descend** | chasms, big drops | glider gear · a flying creature |
| **Illuminate** | dark caves | Lumen lantern / affinity · (without it: Gloom Exposure rises + sight blinded) |
| **Break** | rubble, boulders | crafted breaker · Might threshold · a brute creature |
| **Hazard-wade** | lava / ice / toxic fields | the matching **affinity hazard gear** (same gear that defends Exposure) |

> **Multiple paths to every capability — gear OR class OR creature.** No build is locked out: a pure
> non-creature build crafts the gear; a Tamer build uses creatures; some classes traverse natively.
> This protects class diversity (`CLASSES.md`).

## 2. Elegant overlaps (reuse, not new systems)

- **Hazard gear = traversal gear.** The Heat gear that lets you survive a volcano's Exposure is also
  what lets you *wade the lava field* to reach the loot. Survival prep and traversal are the same kit.
- **Illuminate ↔ Gloom hazard.** A light source both reveals dark caves and suppresses Gloom
  Exposure — one capability, two payoffs.
- **Creature field-utility.** Bound creatures provide swim/fly/smash/light out of battle — making the
  party useful beyond combat and reinforcing "creatures are one pillar, not the only one."
- **Stealth as soft traversal.** Slipping a detection cone (`DESIGN.md`) is how you "pass" patrolled
  routes without a tool — an Infiltrator's traversal.

## 3. Map-authoring hook
Per zone (`WORLD.md §6`), note:
```
Traversal: <which capabilities gate which sub-areas / shortcuts / secret access>
```
Reserve the rarer capabilities (Glide, Hazard-wade for deep hazards) for later regions; Verdara
teaches Ford/Climb/Illuminate/Break as the basics. Relic caches (`HIDDEN_LAYER.md`) often sit behind
a traversal + skill gate.

---

## 4. Scope Honesty
- **Cheap / early:** Ford/Climb/Illuminate/Break as capability flags + tile gates; gear or creature
  grants them.
- **Medium:** creature field-utility, hazard-wade tied to Exposure gear, Glide.
- **Defer:** fancy traversal animations, multi-step traversal puzzles.

## 5. Open Calls
1. **Creature field-utility** — always available if the right creature is in the party, or a learned/
   equipped slot?
2. **How many capabilities** — the 6 above, or trim/expand?
3. **Soft vs hard gates** — do some sub-areas allow a risky no-tool crossing (chance of damage), or
   strict capability checks only?
