# World Atlas — The Four Reaches

> World map plan for the LitRPG survival game. **Overview altitude** — each region drilled
> into town-by-town and zone-by-zone in later passes. Names are **original** (IP-clean).
> Each region is built on existing real-region map data as its geographic foundation
> (noted per region) — the layouts are reused; the names, encounters, tiers, hazards, and
> story are ours.
>
> Companion to `DESIGN.md`. **Status:** brainstorming / pre-implementation.

## 1. Target Length — Content Budget (60+ hours)

A 60h game isn't a long critical path; it's **layered content the survival/Surveillance loop
keeps you in.** Hours come from seven pillars, not from walking distance.

| Pillar | Hrs | What generates the time |
|---|---:|---|
| Main expeditions (story-gated zones) | ~20 | Outfit → push → camp → extract loops through each region's deep zones |
| Calamity Bosses (17 constructs) | ~12 | Prep (gear/affinity/Exposure counters) + the fights + purification re-clears |
| Guild bounty chains (16 guilds) | ~10 | Reputation tiers 0→10k unlock recipes/fast-travel; spread across regions |
| OWPS buried-truth chain | ~8 | The encryption/lockpick/ruin quest line that reveals the cycle |
| Survival + crafting loop (emergent) | ~6+ | Scavenging, hazard-gear crafting, camp expeditions, supply economy |
| Espionage / locked vaults | ~4 | Pre-Awakening vaults gated by Stealth/Lockpicking/Encryption |
| Endgame — purification + endings | ~8 | The Dismantling arc; true ending requires purifying all constructs |
| **Core total** | **~68** | + optional roamers, side caches, cosmetics, NG+ |

**Critical-path pacing** (compressed from the Drive doc's 120h for a tighter 60–65h game):
- **Hrs 0–12** Verdara — learn every system, first Calamity, first glitch/ruin tells.
- **Hrs 10–24** Halveth — specialization, guild verticals, first encrypted archive.
- **Hrs 22–40** Calderra — mastery, weather/sea warfare, the cycle's "made to keep fighting" reveal.
- **Hrs 38–60+** Vael — ascension, full buried truth at the Sunken Ruins, the Distortion endgame.
- Regions **overlap** because the world is open (danger-by-depth, no gating) — these are
  *recommended* bands, not walls. A player can sail to Vael on day one and die in the docks.

## 2. The World — Four Reaches

Four open regions, each dominated by one era-tier but containing pockets of all four.
"Safe" towns are System-protected; everything else is Wildlands.

| Region | Builds on | Role | Hour band | Dominant tier | Signature hazards |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Verdara** | Kanto data | Onramp / tutorial-by-attrition | 0–12 | T1 (~60%) | mostly none; Gloom, pockets of Heat/Toxic |
| **Halveth** | Johto data | Specialization | 10–24 | T2 (~55%) | Gloom, Cold, Toxic |
| **Calderra** | Hoenn data | Mastery | 22–40 | T3 (~50%) | Heat, Tempest, Tide |
| **Vael** | Sinnoh data | Ascension / endgame | 38–60+ | T4 (~50%) | Cold, Gloom |

Hazard legend (player-facing): **Heat · Cold · Toxic · Gloom · Tempest** (defended by affinity
gear/creatures — see `DESIGN.md §3`). Tiers T1–T4 = era danger bands.

---

**Story tells:** the Sunken Ruins lay the cycle bare; the Origin Warden reveals previous loops;
**the Exile delivers the endgame and the four endings.**

---

## 4. Calamity Constructs — Master List

Naming pattern: **[Hazard/Domain] [Class] "[remembered human]"** — each is a previous-cycle
Awakened, remade by the System. Class tiers: *Warden* (standard), *Sovereign* (regional apex),
*Anomaly* (System experiment), *Exile* (the one that got out sideways).

| Construct | Region | Tier | Hint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rime Warden "Marie" | Verdara | T3 | Lighthouse builder, first mate of an Old World ship |
| Storm Warden "the Engineer" | Verdara | T3 | The engineer who refused to leave |
| Pyre Warden "the Record-Burner" | Verdara | T3 | The one who burned the records |
| ANOMALY "Subject Two" | Verdara | T4 | Not a past Awakened — a System experiment. Doesn't speak |
| the Three Reburned (Gale/Spark/Cinder) | Halveth | T3 | Three siblings who died in the spire fire |
| Tide Warden "Aether" | Halveth | T4 | Sealed away, before |
| Pyre Sovereign "Phoenix" | Halveth | T4 | *"Phoenix — meaning rebirth, meaning trap"* |
| the Three Wardens of the Door | Calderra | T4 | Three soldiers — *"guarding the door is all I remember"* |
| Sky Sovereign | Calderra | T4 | *"The sky belonged to us, before"* |
| Abyss Warden / Magma Warden | Calderra | T4 | The two the System made keep fighting |
| the Mirror Pair | Calderra | T4 | Twins who speak only to each other in death |
| Forge Warden | Vael | T4 | *"I crawled in to hide. I never crawled out"* |
| Origin Warden | Vael | T4 | First Awakened of cycle −1 — the previous loop's tutorial boss |
| the Bookkeepers | Vael | T4 | Run the System's time-and-space ledgers |
| the Three Who Saw | Vael | T4 | Children who saw too much |
| the Severed Lovers | Vael | T4 | Lovers separated by a cycle reset |
| **the Exile** | Vael (Distortion) | T4+ | First Awakened to attempt escape; knows everything; endgame |

Each has a **purification alt-clear** (harder, costlier) required for the "Destroy" true ending.
Mythicals are deliberately *not* constructs — they're the cycle's resistance fragments, found via
deep OWPS questing.

---

## 5. Endgame — The Dismantling (Hrs 50–65+)

Triggered after the Sunken Ruins + the Exile. The player gains the ability to speak with
constructs and moves to dismantle the System. **Four endings:**
- **Escape** — break back to the original world. Bittersweet.
- **Inherit** — become the new System. Tragic.
- **Destroy** — end the cycle forever. *True ending — requires purifying all constructs first.*
- **Submit** — refuse the final fight; the cycle continues (you're a construct next loop).

---

## 6. Zone Spec Template (for the per-region drill-downs)

Every zone gets authored with all of this in one pass so world, survival tuning, and story land together:

```
Zone: <name>
Region / builds-on: <region> / <real-area layout>
Tier: T1–T4(+)        Battle format: single | surge-lanes
Hazard(s): Heat|Cold|Toxic|Gloom|Tempest (+ intensity)
Stamina budget: <approx tiles edge-to-objective>   Recommended gear/affinity counters: <...>
Wild roster: <affinity spread + level band>
Scavenge nodes / visible-temptation loot: <what you can SEE and risk for>
Camp anchors: <where a Camp Kit is viable / forward-base spots>
Surveillance notes: <System offers / Audit risk here>
Story beat: <glitch | ruin | vanishing NPC | construct death line | OWPS step>
Warp unlock: <landmark that becomes fast-travel after first survival>
Connections: <adjacent zones / sea routes>
```

---

## 7. Next Passes
1. **Verdara deep-dive** — every town + zone filled to the §6 template (the playable Phase 0–6 slice).
2. Story throughline woven in as we go (tells placed per-zone, not bolted on).
3. Then Halveth → Calderra → Vael.
4. Creatures & affinities after the map/story passes (the core DMCA divergence).
